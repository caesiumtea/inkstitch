<p>I've been using Ink/Stitch exclusively in my freelance digitizing work since the beginning of the New Year [2019]. Finally made it possible for me to only go into my Windows VMs for nostalgia only and not a necessity for day to day work.</p>

<p>I started embroidery with little to no money after buying the machine-- it's been amazing to find a free software with such amazing capabilities. Thank you so much for creating this wonderful software!!</p>
